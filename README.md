# About
This is a repository for my work in Microprocessor-Microcontroller laboratory course.  
This laboratory course mainly guides about writing programs for STM32 MCU on STM32CubeIDE and simulate those on Proteus.
> ðŸ“Œ Note: ðŸš§This repository is under workingðŸš§.  
> Contents and documentation are updated frequently throughout the duration of this course.
# Notice!!
This branch is default branch (a newly created project, nothing done). Switch to another branch for LAB contents.
# Verison
My project here is worked on STM32CubeIDE version 1.19.0 and Proteus 9.0. Please ensures your version of applications is higher or at least compatible with mine.
# Repo's outline
- LAB1: LED Animations. A getting started session, focus on controls pins state of Microcontroller.
- LAB2: Timer Interrupt and LED Scanning. This session is about software-timer and STM32 Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).
